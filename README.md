# matplotlib-challenge

Description:
This is the homework challenge for week 5 of bootcamp. This week, I am given a data set about an animal study
on mice and treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), which is a form of skin cancer. I use pandas and 
matplob to complete several tasks.

Code:
As part of this assignment, I was given a starter code, so much of the framework is already complete. I also
took much of the syntax from lessons in class, as well a brainstorming session with our instructor. One example 
of this is where we are asked to find "duplicate mouse and id data". This was a tough concept we didn't cover in class,
so we had help from the instructor. 

I also needed help from a tutor for this assignment. The majority of the help needed from the tutor was in correcting
syntax. I struggled on the section with outliers and needed assitance there, the tutor helped walked me through putting 
the data into a series.

There were a few questions where I understood the concept of the problem, but had to search out the correct syntax on 
the internet. I had to look up how to change the colors on the boxplot and pie charts.
